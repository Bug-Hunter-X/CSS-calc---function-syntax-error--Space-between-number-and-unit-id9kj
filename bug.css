The following CSS code snippet uses the `calc()` function to calculate the width of an element. However, it contains a syntax error that may not be immediately obvious:  ```css div { width: calc(100% - 10px); } ``` The error is that there is a space between the `10` and the `px`. The `calc()` function requires that the units be directly adjacent to the numeric values.  Removing the space resolves the issue: `width: calc(100% - 10px);`
